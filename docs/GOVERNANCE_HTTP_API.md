# Governance HTTP API & Trust Configuration

The production HTTP and trust layer over the governance primitives (signed
mandates, the ESCALATE approval loop). The HTTP layer is **thin transport**: it
validates schemas, resolves trust, and routes governed execution through the one
existing path. It contains no governance decision logic and creates **no second
execution path** — every governed execution still runs:

```
gateway → coordinator → authority verification → decision token → gate
        → audit-before-actuation → upstream execution
```

## Authentication & authorization boundary

| Boundary | Header | Used by | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|
| **agent** | `X-API-Key` | the proposing agent | verify, execute, create approval, execute approval, read status |
| **operator** | `X-Operator-Key` | a human operator | approve, deny, invalidate, revoke mandate, trust admin |

An empty operator key (`MCC_GATEWAY_OPERATOR_API_KEY` unset) disables **all**
operator actions (fail closed → 403). Operator and agent credentials are
distinct; an agent can never approve or revoke.

## Mandate endpoints

### `POST /mandates/verify` (agent)
```json
{ "mandate": { /* signed mandate */ }, "subject": "agent/x",
  "action": "scale_cluster", "resource": "cluster-prod-1", "policy_hash": null }
```
→ `{ "verified": true, "reason": "MANDATE_VERIFIED", "mandate_id": "mdt-…",
     "issuer_id": "axlogiq-mandates", "constraints": { "max_replicas": 10 } }`

Pure verification (trust resolution + `MandateVerifier`). No execution.

### `POST /mandates/execute` (agent)
```json
{ "mandate": { /* signed mandate */ }, "actor": "agent/x", "action": "scale_cluster",
  "resource": "cluster-prod-1", "context": { "target": "cluster-prod-1",
  "environment": "prod", "replicas": 5 }, "transaction_id": "txn-1",
  "idempotency_key": "op-1" }
```
→ `{ "status": "EXECUTED", "reason": "executed", "decision": "ALLOW",
     "audit_ref": "…", "execution": { /* upstream result */ } }`

Runs trust → `MandateAuthority` → decision token → `EnforcementCoordinator`
(gate + binding + nonce, revocation re-check, idempotency, velocity,
audit-before-actuation) → upstream. Any failure → `status: "BLOCKED"` (or
`"EXECUTION_FAILED"` if the executor raised after authorization) and the
upstream is never reached.

**Action names (R4 remediation).** The shipped governed upstreams POST to
`{base}/{action}`, so `action` must follow the action-name contract in
`mcc_core.action_name`:
- one or more dot-separated segments of ASCII `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`;
- the name starts with a letter or digit;
- at most 128 characters.

For example: `send_payment`, `http.egress`, `github.create_issue`.

Anything else is refused on every execute route (`/mandates/execute`,
`/approvals/{id}/execute`, `/consensus/execute`, and the delegation service)
with `status: "BLOCKED"`, `decision: "DENY"`, `reason: "INVALID_ACTION_NAME: …"`.
That includes:
- `/`, `\`, `?`, `#`, `%`, `;`, `:`, `@`;
- whitespace, control characters and non-ASCII;
- an empty name, `.` / `..`, and a leading, trailing or doubled dot.

The refusal happens before the authority, the token, any idempotency or
velocity reservation, the audit record, and the upstream. The name is never
encoded or stripped into a different action. Each URL-building upstream also
refuses such a name before opening a connection. Before R4, a wildcard scope
such as `pay_*` authorized `pay_x/../../admin/wipe`, which the HTTP client
sent as `POST /admin/wipe`.

### `GET /mandates/{mandate_id}/revocation` (agent)
→ `{ "mandate_id": "mdt-…", "status": "ACTIVE" | "REVOKED" | "UNAVAILABLE" }`

### `POST /mandates/{mandate_id}/revoke` (operator)
→ `{ "ok": true }`

### Trust admin (operator)
* `GET /trust` → issuer/key summary (**no key material**).
* `POST /trust/issuers/{issuer_id}/disable` → `{ "ok": true }`
* `POST /trust/keys/{kid}/revoke` → `{ "ok": true }`

## ESCALATE approval endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/approvals` | agent — create a `PENDING` request |
| `GET` | `/approvals/{id}` | agent — status (non-sensitive) |
| `POST` | `/approvals/{id}/approve` | operator — mints the signed single-use mandate |
| `POST` | `/approvals/{id}/deny` | operator — terminal |
| `POST` | `/approvals/{id}/invalidate` | operator |
| `POST` | `/approvals/{id}/execute` | agent — consume single-use + execute |

Operator workflow:

1. The agent's proposal evaluates to `ESCALATE` → `POST /approvals` with the
   operation's `actor/action/resource/transaction_id/policy_hash/payload_hash`.
   Optional `constraints` must follow the constraint contract
   (`docs/SIGNED_MANDATES.md`); an unsupported or malformed set is rejected
   with **HTTP 422** `INVALID_CONSTRAINTS` and no request is created (R3).
   An `action` outside the action-name contract (see `POST /mandates/execute`)
   is rejected with **HTTP 422** `INVALID_ACTION_NAME`, again with no request
   created (R4).
2. An operator reviews and `approve`s (returns a scoped, signed, single-use
   approval mandate) or `deny`s (terminal). **Approval does not execute.**
3. The agent calls `/approvals/{id}/execute` with the mandate; the coordinator
   consumes the approval single-use at actuation and executes.

States: `PENDING → APPROVED → CONSUMED`; `DENIED`/`EXPIRED`/`INVALIDATED`
terminal. Reuse, substitution, mutation, timeout, policy drift, and actor/
resource/action-hash mismatch all fail closed; concurrent execution has a single
winner (atomic consume).

## Multi-issuer trust set

`MCC_TRUST_CONFIG` points at a JSON file (see `config/trust.pilot.example.json`)
holding **only public keys**:

```json
{ "issuers": [ { "issuer_id": "axlogiq-mandates", "enabled": true,
  "keys": [ { "kid": "axlogiq-mandates-2026a",
              "public_key_b64": "<32-byte raw Ed25519, base64>",
              "not_after": null } ] } ] }
```

* **Issuer IDs and key IDs** — each `kid` is globally unique; `resolve(kid)`
  returns a distinct status (`OK` / `UNKNOWN_KID` / `DISABLED_ISSUER` /
  `EXPIRED_KEY` / `REVOKED_KEY`).
* **Multiple keys per issuer** — for rotation; all active keys verify.
* The gateway's own **approver** key is trusted by construction (issuer
  `mcc/approvals`), not via this file.

### Key-rotation procedure
1. Generate a new issuer key (`scripts/generate_signing_key.py`); keep the
   private key in the issuer's secret store.
2. Add a new `{kid, public_key_b64}` entry to the issuer's `keys` and reload.
3. Switch the issuer to sign new mandates with the new `kid`.
4. After all old mandates expire, set `not_after` on (or remove) the old key.

### Issuer-revocation procedure
* Disable an issuer: `POST /trust/issuers/{id}/disable` (runtime) or
  `enabled: false` in config (durable). All its mandates stop verifying.
* Revoke a single key: `POST /trust/keys/{kid}/revoke` (runtime) or
  `revoked: true` in config.

### Startup validation (fail-closed)
`MCC_ENV=pilot` **requires** a valid, non-empty `MCC_TRUST_CONFIG` and refuses
to start otherwise (`TrustConfigError`) — there is **no silent fallback to a
development key**. `dev`/`test` default to an empty trust set. Malformed config
(bad JSON, non-32-byte key, duplicate kid, empty keys) refuses startup in pilot.

## Deployment architecture

```
agent ──X-API-Key──► MCC gateway (HTTP) ──► GovernanceService
operator ─X-Operator-Key─►              │      trust set (public keys, config)
                                        │      MandateVerifier / MandateAuthority
                                        │      EnforcementCoordinator
                                        │        gate (Ed25519 + binding + nonce)
                                        │        revocation / idempotency / velocity / approvals (Redis)
                                        │        audit-before-actuation (hash chain)
                                        └────────► upstream (MCC_UPSTREAM_BASE)
```

Backends are env-selected and fail-closed with no silent fallback:
`MCC_NONCE_BACKEND`, `MCC_IDEMPOTENCY_BACKEND`, `MCC_VELOCITY_BACKEND`,
`MCC_REVOCATION_BACKEND`, `MCC_APPROVAL_BACKEND` (`memory` | `redis`, each needs
`MCC_REDIS_URL` for `redis`). See `RUNTIME_DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Threat model additions

| Attack | Defense |
|---|---|
| forged mandate / approval | Ed25519 signature over all claims; untrusted kid → `UNKNOWN_KID` |
| mandate / approval substitution | `mandate_id` / `approval_id` bound into the token; consume binds action_hash/transaction/payload |
| actor / resource / action substitution | mandate subject & scopes; gate binding; payload_hash |
| action name altering the upstream URL (traversal, query/fragment, CR/LF, encoded or absolute forms) | action-name contract enforced before authority/token/reservation and again at each URL-building upstream → `INVALID_ACTION_NAME`, zero outbound requests (R4) |
| transaction substitution | `transaction_id` in token + approval record |
| policy drift | mandate `policy_hash` binding → `POLICY_BINDING_MISMATCH` |
| replay / double-consume | nonce (token) + idempotency (operation) + single-use approval (atomic `SET NX`) |
| race conditions | atomic reservations; exactly-one consume winner |
| expired / revoked authority | validity window; revocation at decision **and** actuation |
| disabled issuer / unknown kid | trust resolution with distinct status |
| unavailable Redis / revocation / approval store | fail closed (DENY / BLOCKED), never silent fallback |
| malformed HTTP payload | strict (extra-forbid) schemas → 422 |
| bypassing coordinator/gate; direct upstream | no endpoint reaches the upstream except via `coordinator.enforce` |
| key/trust material exposure | only public keys held; summaries omit key material; private keys never returned or logged |

## Migration / backward compatibility

Purely additive. No existing endpoint, token field, or behavior changed; the
governance HTTP routes are new paths. The new env vars (`MCC_ENV`,
`MCC_TRUST_CONFIG`, `MCC_APPROVER_SIGNING_KEY_PATH`, `MCC_GATEWAY_OPERATOR_API_KEY`,
`MCC_UPSTREAM_BASE`, `MCC_REVOCATION_BACKEND`, `MCC_APPROVAL_BACKEND`) all default
to safe dev values; the only startup-affecting one is `MCC_ENV=pilot`, which
deliberately refuses an invalid trust root. See `docs/MIGRATION_NOTES.md`.
